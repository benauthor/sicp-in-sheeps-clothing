SICP, scheme, JS, and whatnot.
==============================

This started as a repo for my working-through of the exercises in SICP,
motivated by a [study group at HacDC](http://wiki.hacdc.org/index.php/Schemers).
A flippant quotation by Crockford got me amped to try some of the exercises
in JS. Figured do some in Python as well, for laughs.

The study group has (d)evolved into an enjoyable bull session, with
relatively little attention payed to the exercises themselves, but I
plan to keep chugging through, as my attention and energy allows.
